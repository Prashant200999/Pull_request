## Introduction
License scanning in CI is the automated process of identifying and ensuring compliance with the licenses of third-party dependencies in a project.

---

## Why License Scanning?
- **Legal Compliance:** Ensures the project complies with open-source license requirements.
- **Risk Mitigation:** Prevents using dependencies with incompatible or restrictive licenses.
- **Security:** Identifies licenses that may have known security vulnerabilities.
- **Automated Checks:** Streamlines the process of tracking and managing licenses during development.
- **Avoid Legal Disputes:** Helps avoid potential legal conflicts over license violations.
