## Introduction

High Availability (HA) in Jenkins ensures that CI/CD pipelines continue running smoothly, even in the event of hardware or software failures. This is crucial for organizations that depend on Jenkins for continuous integration and delivery, as it helps minimize downtime and maintain productivity.

#### Jenkins can be set up in HA mode using two methods:
- Active/Passive Configuration
- HA Setup with an Autoscaling Group

## Why Jenkins High Availability?

| **Reason**               | **Description**                                                                                 |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Business Continuity**   | Ensure Jenkins services remain uninterrupted.                                                          |
| **Minimize Downtime**     | Prevent system failures from impacting CI/CD pipelines.        |
| **Scalability**           | Expand Jenkins capacity by distributing workloads efficiently.                               |
| **Load Balancing**        | Enhance performance and resilience by distributing traffic across multiple instances. |

## Architecture 

| **Component**            | **Description**                                                                                 |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Jenkins Master**        | Manages jobs, configurations, and the overall Jenkins environment. Multiple masters behind a load balancer ensure high availability. |
| **Jenkins Agents** | Distribute workloads across multiple machines in HA setups. |
| **Shared Storage**        | Stores configurations, jobs, logs, and artifacts in a shared file system accessible by all nodes. |
| **Database Replication**  | Ensures job histories, configurations, and logs are stored in a replicated database to prevent data loss. |
| **Load Balancer**         | Distributes incoming traffic across Jenkins masters and redirects it to a healthy master if a failure occurs.|

## High Availability Setup Steps

## Step 1: Setting Up Multiple Jenkins Masters

1. **Install Jenkins on Multiple Machines**
 - Install Jenkins on at least two separate machines or virtual instances. These will be your Jenkins masters.

2. **Configure Jenkins Masters**
 - Ensure that both Jenkins masters have identical configurations (same jobs, plugins, etc.).

3. **Database Configuration**
 - Configure the Jenkins masters to point to the same shared database for storing job configurations, user data, and job history.

4. **Configure Load Balancer**
 - Set up a load balancer (e.g., HAProxy or Nginx) to distribute traffic between the Jenkins masters.


## Step 2: Configuring Jenkins Agents

1. **Set Up Jenkins Agents**
 - Install Jenkins agents (slaves) on multiple machines or containers. These agents will be used to execute Jenkins jobs.

2. **Connect Agents to Masters**
 - Ensure the Jenkins agents are connected to all Jenkins masters to allow job execution from any master.
 - Use the "Node Management" section in the Jenkins UI to add agents.

3. **Distribute Job Load**
 - Use the load balancer to distribute job requests evenly across available Jenkins agents.

## Step 3: Shared File System Setup

1. **Install NFS/Cloud Storage**
 - Set up a shared file system using NFS or cloud storage (e.g., AWS EFS, Google Cloud Storage).
  
2. **Mount Shared Storage**
 - Mount the shared storage on all Jenkins masters and agents to ensure they can access the same data.
   
## Step 4: Backups and Disaster Recovery

1. **Backup Jenkins Configurations and Data**
 - Install and configure the ThinBackup plugin to automate the backup of Jenkins data, including configurations, jobs, and artifacts.
  
2. **Ensure Consistency**
 - Schedule regular backups of both the shared file system and Jenkins database to ensure consistency.

## Step 5: Testing and Validation

1. **Failover Testing**
 - Perform regular failover testing by manually stopping one Jenkins master to confirm that the load balancer properly redirects traffic to the backup master.

2. **Job Execution Validation**
 - Ensure that Jenkins jobs continue to run on agents even if one Jenkins master goes down.
  
3. **Monitor System Health**
 - Set up monitoring for Jenkins masters, agents, and the load balancer to track system health and performance.

## Benefits of Jenkins High Availability

| **Benefit**                    | **Description**                                                         |
|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Reduced Downtime**          | Minimizes service interruptions during failures by quickly rerouting traffic.|
| **Optimized Load**           | Distributes the load evenly across multiple Jenkins instances, enhancing performance.|
| **Scalability**                 | Allows for easy expansion of Jenkins to accommodate increasing demands with additional masters and agents. |
| **High Availability**                  | Maintains continuous operation through redundant Jenkins instances and agents. |
| **Continuous Operations**         | Guarantees uninterrupted CI/CD pipelines, even in the event of system failures.|

## Conclusion

Configuring Jenkins for high availability is crucial to maintaining the continuous operation and efficiency of your CI/CD pipelines, even in the event of system failures. By utilizing multiple Jenkins masters, distributed agents, shared storage, and load balancing, you can create a robust and scalable Jenkins environment. Implementing these best practices along with a disaster recovery plan will minimize downtime and ensure your software delivery pipeline remains uninterrupted and reliable.
